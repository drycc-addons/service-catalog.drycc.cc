<p>title: Remove a Stuck Instance or Binding
layout: docwithnav
â€”</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons, a service broker may stop responding to requests.
A user may still need to remove instances and bindings belonging to that broker,
bypassing the safeguards normally in place. Note that these are are destructive
operations that may leave orphaned state still existing on the broker.</p>

<p>Service Catalog maintains a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#finalizers">finalizer</a>
on each of the resources it maintains. This prevents the resource from being
deleted before Service Catalog has a chance to reconcile the resource with
the relevant service broker. In the event that an instance becomes stuck,
manually removing the finalizer will allow the resource to be deleted. The finalizer can
be manualy removed with <code class="highlighter-rouge">kubectl</code>, or by using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--abandon</code> flag in the svcat <code class="highlighter-rouge">deprovision</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">unbind</code> commands.</p>

<p>Note that bindings belonging to the instance will not be cleaned up as part of the operation, and should be manually cleaned up before deprovisioning the instance.</p>
